Compiler for Javalette, part A, version 1
-----------------------------------------

Build the compiler by running the command
    make
in the src/ directory. This compiles the files TypeChecker.hs, ReturnChecker.hs and Main.hs. Remove generated files by running the command
    clean
in the same directory.

Run the compiler with the command
    ./jlc testfile.jl
where testfile is a Javalette file.

See the file src/Javalette.cf for specification of the language.

The grammar has one shift/reduce conflict: the dangling else.
