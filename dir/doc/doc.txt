Compiler for Javalette, part C, version 1
-----------------------------------------

Build the compiler by running the command
    make
in the src/ directory. Remove generated files by running the command
    clean
in the same directory.

Run the compiler with the command
    ./jlc test.jl
where test.jl is a Javalette file. This will produce the files test.ll and
test.bc in the same directory as test.jl, and the files main.bc, main.o and 
a.out in the same directory as jlc. a.out holds the output of the program in 
test.jl.

See the file src/Javalette.cf for specification of the language. The grammar 
has one shift/reduce conflict: the dangling else.

Implemented extensions:
  Â¤ One-dimensional arrays and for loops
