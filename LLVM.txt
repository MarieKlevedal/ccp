icmp
---- 
The 'icmp' instruction returns a boolean value or a vector of boolean values based on comparison of its two integer, integer vector, pointer, or pointer vector operands.

The ‘icmp‘ instruction takes three operands. The first operand is the condition code indicating the kind of comparison to perform. It is not a value, just a keyword. The possible condition codes are:

eq: equal
ne: not equal
ugt: unsigned greater than
uge: unsigned greater or equal
ult: unsigned less than
ule: unsigned less or equal
sgt: signed greater than
sge: signed greater or equal
slt: signed less than
sle: signed less or equal
The remaining two arguments must be integer or pointer or integer vector typed. They must also be identical types.
